Welcome to the Zhou lab. We are a group of statisticians and computational biologists developing statistical methods and computational tools for genetic and genomic studies. These studies often involve large-scale and high-dimensional data; examples include genome-wide association studies and various functional genomic sequencing studies such as bulk and single cell RNA sequencing, bisulfite sequencing, and spatially resolved transcriptomics. By developing novel analytic methods, we seek to extract important information from these data and to advance our understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic variation for various human diseases and disease related quantitative traits.

We are actively looking to expand our group. We are based in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. Contact me if you are interested in joining us.
