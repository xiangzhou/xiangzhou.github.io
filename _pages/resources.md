## Comparison of dimensionality reduction methods for single cell RNAseq analysis

In this study, we compared 11 different Dimensionality reduction (DR) methods on 28 publicly available scRNAseq data sets that cover a range of sequencing techniques and sample sizes. The performance of different DR methods are evaluated in terms of their accuracy and robustness in both cell clustering and lineage reconstruction downstream analyses.

All data, analysis code and scripts used in the paper are available on <a href="https://github.com/xzhoulab/DRComparison">github</a>.
